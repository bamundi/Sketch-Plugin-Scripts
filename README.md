### Simple Pattern

Duplicate the selection (or use the five selections) and put them into repeatable pattern position.
The original selection is placed at center of the artboard.
The duplicated ones are placed at top left, top right, bottom left and bottom right correspondingly.

When you select 1 object, the script duplicates it into 5 copies. If you select 5 objects, the script uses the 5 selections directlyt.
